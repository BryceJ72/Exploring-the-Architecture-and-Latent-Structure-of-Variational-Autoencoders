# Exploring-the-Architecture-and-Latent-Structure-of-Variational-Autoencoders
This project investigates the architecture and latent structure of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). It begins with an in-depth exploration of the mathematical foundations underlying VAEs, providing a robust theoretical framework for understanding their functionality. Following a repro- duction of the results from the original VAE paper, an experiment was conducted on the MNIST dataset to determine a minimal complexity architecture for the encoder and decoder. The study then extends to the CelebA dataset, where a VAE was implemented to achieve attribute manipula- tion in human face images. The analysis focuses on identifying which attributes most significantly contribute to perceived attractiveness. The primary goal of this project is to thoroughly explore and elucidate the architecture and latent structure of VAEs, contributing valuable insights into their design and application.
